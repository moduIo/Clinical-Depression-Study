# Clinical-Depression-Study
Data analysis and models for clinical depression medication study.

Used various classifiers to determine if a depression patient was responsive to SSRI treatment as early as possible.  My results show that by the 4th week there is high accuracy in prediction, a 50% decrease in diagnosis time.
